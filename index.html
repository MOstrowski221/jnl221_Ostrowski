		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/" target="_blank">Women's pockets</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics</li>

		</ul> 
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>
		<h3> <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics </h3> 

		<p> I chose to focus on the Rueters Story, "A window into Delhi's deadly pollution." The data in this article was collected by two sources: Reuters directly via a camera that they set up at the Parsvnath Capital Towers building, and information they retrieved from a sensor at the Central Pollution Control Boardâ€™s Mandir Marg air quality monitoring station. The data was collected between October 20 and November 8, 2018. The project utilizes a time lapse of the video taken to demonstrate the severe drop of air quality at times over that period. The time lapse, activated by scrolling down the page and accompanied by explanatory text, demonstrates a "night and day" difference (sometimes literally between nighttime and during the day) between levels of pollution in the city at different times. This includes a point where the pollution was so bad that the device measuring it overloaded and temporarily stopped working. It was followed by a series of still images that demonstrate the pollution at 11 A.M. each day during the period of observation. It points out November 5th as the worst level of pollution, where it is difficult to see buildings that are as little as a block away, never mind the Parliament building that is used as a reference point. </p>
		<p> Additionally, there is a side-by-side comparison of pictures taken just one hour apart. These pictures show how smog can appear seemingly out of nowhere in a very short period of time. The story also uses a vertical range chart to illustrate the differences in air pollution levels measured by numerous health stations across the city. It shows both the average and the maximum/minimum pollution level over this time. This is where the story drops a bombshell: even though the images show very low visibility and obvious smoke in the air, it turns out that this isn't even the worst part of the city in terms of air quality. It is at the worst *time* of the year, just not the worst spot in the Indian capital. All of these tools combine to do an excellent job informing the reader of the sharp contrast in pollution levels depending on the time of day and location within Delhi. The pictures and video timelapse create a visual image of the events unfolding, while text and the chart describe what is occurring in simple terms. </p>
		<p> It's clear that the primary purpose in creating this dataviz project was to bring awareness to the poor air quality in Dehli. The artcle states that Dehli is the 6th worst in terms of air cleanliness, and India as a whole has 14 of the worst 15 cities in this category. It also notes that this issue has been ongoing for a long time and was supposed to be addressed by the time that the story was published. Including the vivid imagery of grey skies gives the project a visceral aspect. We in the United States would rarely experience polluted skies anything like this. I've been to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Atlanta, all major U.S. cities, and none have anywhere near this level of pollution. Even close to where I grew up, where the coal mining industry used to be king, the air is still relatively clear. Seeing these images where there is an abundance of smog, compared to the clean Syracuse skyline and view of campus & downtown I can see outside my dorm window, is a real eye-opener.

		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
